# 💻 Exercises<br>
**Exercise 1: <br>
🔄 String Manipulation**<br>
This program takes a string as an argument, reverses it, swaps its letter's case (upper to lower and vice versa), and prints the result. It's a fun exercise to understand how strings can be manipulated in Python.

**Exercise 2: <br>
🔢 Number Type Checking**<br>
A program that takes a number as an argument and checks whether it's odd, even, or zero. This will give you a good understanding of conditional statements in Python.

**Exercise 3: <br>
🔎 Text Analyzer**<br>
A function called text_analyzer that accepts a string argument and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters, and spaces. This will give you hands-on experience on how to analyze data in a string.

**Exercise 4: <br>
➕➖✖️➗ Basic Arithmetic Operations**<br>
A program that takes two integers as arguments and performs the basic arithmetic operations: sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder. This will help you understand how Python handles different arithmetic operations.

**Exercise 5:<br>
🎭 String Formatting**<br>
This exercise will get you familiar with the concept of string formatting in Python through a series of examples. String formatting is a powerful feature that allows you to insert variables into a string in a concise and readable way.

**Exercise 6: <br>
📚 Nested Dictionaries**<br>
In this exercise, you'll create a nested dictionary to store recipes for a cookbook. You'll learn how to add, delete, and print data from this nested dictionary, which will give you a strong understanding of how to work with complex data structures in Python.

**Exercise 7: <br>
🔍 Word Length Filtering**<br>
A program that filters words in a string based on their length. This program will give you good practice with list comprehensions, one of Python's most powerful features.

**Exercise 8: <br>
📡 Morse Code Encoding**<br>
A program that encodes a string into Morse code. This is a fun way to understand how encoding and decoding works in Python.

**Exercise 9: <br>
🎲 Interactive Guessing Game**<br>
This is an interactive number guessing game. It will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 99. The game ends when the user finds out the secret number or types 'exit'. This game will help you understand user interaction and control flow in Python.

**Exercise 10: <br>
🔄 Progress Indicator for Loops**<br>
This exercise will introduce you to the yield operator in Python. You'll create a function that displays the progress of a for loop. This will give you an understanding of how to track the progress of long-running tasks in Python.
